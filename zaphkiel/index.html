            Zaphkiel is a guy from the Golden Garden era. He didn’t live through
            it much Tho. He was there only as a baby. Once the Golden Garden
            fell his father took him to farm far away to hide him from
            separatists that wanted to kill everyone with any connection to the
            Strellizia family. He lived on a farm for a several years until some
            girl with black hair came in saying she was his sister and that she
            had a soul for him. When he refused, she got mad and wanted to fight
            him. Although he refused, she started to attack him with her scythe
            yelling at him that she killed her father for his life. He was
            confused yet he fought back to survive. Doing that he summoned Cali
            the Timespace goddess, and she helped him stop the women. Cali
            offered Zaphkiel training so he would get stronger and get some
            special powers. Zaphkiel agrees and is killed by Cali in that
            moment. She rips out his broken soul and merges it with the soul
            from the girl. Then she creates a new vessel for that new soul. Once
            he is resurrected, he is told how things work and that girl really
            is his sister named Arya. She also enlightens him of his amnesia and
            his old family. He then goes with Cali into the sea of quanta where
            she teaches him how to control time.
