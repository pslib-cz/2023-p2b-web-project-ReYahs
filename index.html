        <p>Who are those 2</p>
        <p>
          Arya and Zaphkiel are siblings from a fictional world full of magic.
          Zaphkiel is the younger brother and is very reckless and takes
          everything lightly. While Arya is a smart elf who tries to improve the
          world around her. One day, however, their lives change. Zaphkiel loses
          his soul, and his sister must find a replacement to survive. And so,
          she meets a Timespace character who promises to help her if she takes
          on the 8 mist demons. Arya accomplishes this task but ends up
          destroying her because the 8th, most powerful mist demon is her own
          father. Arya is thus faced with the dilemma "Save her brother and lose
          her father or let her brother die but her father survives". Arya
          chooses her brother, thus defeating her father as well. When she then
          goes to Timespace with the fact that she has completed the task, she
          sends her to the future to find a suitable soul for her brother.
          However, she cannot find a soul here, and panics that she has failed.
          However, he meets an adult Zaphkiel here, who has a fragmented soul
          enriched by several other souls, holding it together, so she begins to
          search for a way to return and donate a part of her soul to his
          brother. On her way back, however, she encounters a dying boy who
          holds one half of a white soul. She befriends this boy and takes his
          soul from him. Back at home, Arya tries to give Zaphkiel his new soul,
          but Timespace stops her, saying that this soul is destined to become
          the new soul for the Time Lord and shows her the other green half.
          Arya proposes a deal where Zaphkiel becomes the new Time Lord but is
          saved at the same time. Timespace approaches but takes Zaphkiel with
          her to the "sea of quanta" where she will teach him. Arya's story ends
          here for now. Begins the story of Zaphkiel, who learns to control time
          and also bend reality. Over time, he grows stronger and becomes a
          capable Time Ruler who tries to find a way to integrate into the human
          world. He builds a new city where he begins to gather many races to
          live here in peace. Here, however, he has to face a mysterious demon
          who walks around at night and kills the residents of his town. He
          confronts this demon on the tallest skyscraper in his city and
          discovers that it is one of the demons of the Mist that survived
          Arya's battle. He will defeat and humiliate this demon. He also kicks
          her out of town. But she comes back and gets as high as she can in
          republican society, until she gets right up to Zaphkiel's level. There
          she becomes a new threat to society as she opposes Zaphkiel and is
          constantly trying to take him down. She tries to hunt Zaphkiel down
          and make him pay for the other 7 mist demons that have died because of
          his sister. She almost manages to do it, but she is stopped by the
          Timespace herself and imprisoned.
